# Exoplanet Radial Velocity Functions

Some Python code and functions to process exoplanet radial velocity observations from various telescopes and produce some figures to visualize the data using Matplotlib.

## Description

These are some functions I have written in Python for processing radial velocity measurements obtained from various telescopes as well as to visualize the data, phase fold it to a specifi planetary orbital period and mid transit time.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

In general, these functions will require at minimum:
* Python 3.7 or newer
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* csv
* pyexcel

### Installing

* Download the functions and put them in a easy to access directory.

### Executing program

* cd to directory where you have placed the files.
* Modify the variables in the code containing hard coded directory paths as appropriate.
* python filename.py, replacing filename.py with the appropriate name of the file.

## Help

I no longer update these functions but have provided them here in case they are of use to the community. You can email me if you are having issues getting these functions to work.
